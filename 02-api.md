In this section we will create a simple API Gateway that responds to `GET /hello`

## Instructions

1. Replace `backebd/main.w`with the following content:
  ```ts
  bring cloud;
  bring http;
  bring expect;

  let api = new cloud.Api();

  test "GET hello" {
    let url = api.url;
    let res = http.get("{url}/hello");
    expect.equal(res.status, 200);
    expect.equal(res.body, "React Wing Workshop");
  }
  ```
2. Run it locally
```sh
  wing run backedn/main.w
```
3. Run the test from Wing Console (left hand side) and examine the test result in the logs area (bottom side)

5. Can you fix the code so the test pass? (Hint: [`cloud.Api`docs](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/api))

  <details>
    <summary>Solution</summary>
    
    
    api.get("/hello", inflight () => {
      return {
        status:200,
        body:"React Wing Workshop"
      };
    });
    
    
  </details>

You can now use different options to see that your api gateway is working: 
- When `wing run backend/main.w` is running you can:
  - Run tests from the Wing Console
  - Interactively test the `/hello` endpoint from within the Wing Console
  - Interactively test the `/hello` endpoint using your browser
- Run tests using the cli `wing test backend/main.w`

ðŸš€ Great, you just finished creating a simple hello world web service ðŸš€
